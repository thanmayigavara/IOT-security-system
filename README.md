IoT based smart Security System

This project demonstrates a Smart Security System built using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The system is designed to detect unauthorized motion, capture real-time images, and send instant alerts to the userâ€™s mobile application, ensuring efficient monitoring and improved safety for homes or restricted spaces.

 Objective:

To develop a real-time security prototype that automates intrusion detection using motion sensors and notifies users instantly through a mobile app with image evidence.


How It Works:

1. The system continuously monitors for motion using the PIR sensor.


2. When motion is detected, the camera module is activated to capture an image.


3. The image, along with an alert message (like "Motion Detected!"), is sent in real-time to the user's smartphone app.


4. Optionally, the data can also be saved to cloud storage for later review.


Real-Time Alerts: Immediate push notifications or messages to the mobile device.

Image Evidence: Automatically captures and sends photos upon motion detection.

Remote Monitoring: View alerts and images from anywhere using internet-connected devices.
